## Next Steps
Add the functionality to prevent the same Pokemon from being included as a 
member multiple times in the same team - this is because in the games, you 
cannot have the same Pokemon twice on your team in a player-vs-player battle.

Add functionality to create teams for games other than Generation 1 games.
